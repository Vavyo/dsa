# Insert to an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Take in an array of integers and return it with an integer added to the middle.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Split and shift an array to make room for a new integer to be added to the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
We created a new array object and assigned the values, sorting using if else statements.

The Big O notation for this should be O(n).
